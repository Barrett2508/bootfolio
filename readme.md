Welcome to Barrett's 2023 BS5 portfolio theme! 

This theme has been set up as a generic theme for you to fine-tune to your needs, throughout the HTML document you will find handy notes with suggestions or instructions on what can and should be changed as well as how you can change it ðŸ˜Š. The responsiveness to different screen sizes is already handled for you! In the CSS file, I have put some notes in places where you can target certain elements and change their styling and colors if you so wish. 

In this document, I will add some code snippets in case you wish to add extra projects or anything. I will explain exactly what the snippets do, as well as where you should place them.
